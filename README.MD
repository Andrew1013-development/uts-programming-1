## How to look up
On the first line of every solution file, there exists a comment to mark each source file / folder to the problem they correspond to:

General syntax `Q{q}-W{w}-(-A)`
- `Q{q}` - The question number (also increments on non-coding questions, meaning the counting might not start at 1 or be perfectly sequential)
- `W{w}` - The lab week this problem is in
- `-A` - usually omitted, only used to denote questions belonging to an "assessment" section
- Examples:
    - `Q6-W5`: Question 6 of Week 5 Lab
    - `Q1-W1-A`: Question 1 of Week 1 Lab Assessment
